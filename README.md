# ENCE260 Assignment: CATCHIN BALL Z

This is a two player game, that uses the  UC Fun Kit 4.


## Starting the game

1) Title screen will appear showing "CATCHIN BALL Z".

2) Players begin by each pressing button one, this exits the intro screen and enters
the ready screen.

3) "Ready?" will scroll on screen. One player pushes the navswitch to establish them self as player one. Player one 
starts with the ball.

## Movement
Players can move left to right on the bottom of the screen. If a player is in the far right corner and moves right.
the player will teleport to the left-most corner. This is the similar for the left corner. 

## Passing ball
Players pass the ball by pushing down on the navswitch. The ball moves North (90 degrees to the movement axis).


## Objective/ How to play
The objective of this game is to pass the ball so that the other player does not 
catch it. The player throwing the ball takes time to throw, this give the opponent time
to move into a position to catch it. If the opponent fails to get in line in time, they will
be eliminated from the screen and the game will be lost. Each time you catch the ball you will be teleported to the middle
of your display. 
When the game is finished “YOU LOSE :(“ will be displayed on the
losers screen.
